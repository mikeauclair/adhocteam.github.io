        <h2>The HealthCare.gov rescue</h2>
        <p>
          In the days following the initial launch of HealthCare.gov in the fall
          of 2013, the White House, under the direction of U.S. Chief Technology
          Officer Todd Park, assembled a team of top engineering talent from
          outside of government, including software developers, designers, and
          operations experts who had worked in Silicon Valley and technology
          startups around the country. Crucially, they all had experience
          delivering high-quality consumer experiences and operating
          high-traffic websites, exactly the expertise needed to run a site like
          HealthCare.gov.

        <p>
          Greg and Paul, Ad Hoc's cofounders and principals, were part of that
          original group, known as the "ad hoc team", that went in among the
          contractors and government officials who had built HealthCare.gov. The
          team assessed the situation, delivered specific and actionable
          recommendations, and melded in with existing teams to provide
          leadership and guidance in service of righting the ship and turning
          HealthCare.gov around, so that it would be able to achieve its goal of
          signing up millions of Americans with health insurance coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through a concerted effort that involved long hours and constant
          focus, by the end of 2013, a mere two-and-a-half months after arriving
          on site, the team had helped bring HealthCare.gov, a site that
          enrolled a mere 6 people on its launch day, to the point where it
          could enroll hundreds of thousands of Americans each day in affordable
          health coverage, and the organization and processes it established
          during the rescue put it well on its way to becoming a stable part of
          the American welfare system.
